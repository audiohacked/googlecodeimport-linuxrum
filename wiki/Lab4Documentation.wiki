Lab 4 is about memory management. Specifically pages. Part I deals with reporting memory management statistics. Part II deals with replacing the page replacement algorithm.


= Part I =
In this part, you are asked to collect a number of memory management statistics:

   1. the current number of pages in the active list (over all memory zones);
   2. the current number of pages in the inactive list (over all memory zones);
   3. the current number of pages in the active list whose reference bits are set (over all memory zones);
   4. the current number of pages in the inactive list whose reference bits are set (over all memory zones);
   5. the cumulative number of pages moved from the active list to the inactive list (since the last machine boot);
   6. the cumulative number of pages evicted from the inactive list (since the last machine boot);
   7. a list of the number of pages allocated to all active processes.

Provide a system call that reports these statistics to user level applications.

For each of statistics 3, 4, 5, 6, you should provide a program that triggers the statistics change and reason about such change. Take statistics 6 (the cumulative number of pages evicted from the inactive list) as an example, you should provide a program that triggers additional page evictions from the inactive list so the reported statistics 6 will change after you run the program. It is OK if you use one program to trigger the changes of multiple statistics as long as you can reason about these changes.
