#summary This is where our documentation for the final lab goes.

= Introduction =
Lab 4 is about memory management. Specifically pages. Part I deals with reporting memory management statistics. Part II deals with replacing the page replacement algorithm.


= Part I =
We decided to call the directory that contains our system call 'rum', since that's the name of our group. We called the function itself mem_stats, and it returns an int pointer, which in turn has 7 values, each corresponding to those required in the lab.

Also added rum/ to the core-y          += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ 
line in the Makefile in the top level of the kernel, line 555. Then added a Makefile to the rum/ directory with the following contents:

obj-y   := mem_stats.o

Then we added the following lines to include/asm-x86-64/unistd.h:

`#define __NR_mem_stats          280`

`__SYSCALL(__NR_mem_stats, sys_mem_stats)`

= Part II =

Scanning code for reference count:

Within shrink_active_list, it isolates all of LRU pages to a holding list. It loops through the list. For each page, there's a reference count. For each page that's referenced, our code increments ref_count, which holds the reference count for the page. The function called page_referenced will check if the reference bit flag of the page is set, and if it is, it adds it to the reference count. Then, after that, it removes the page from the zone's active list. It'll check if the page is mapped, and if so, it does another check to reclaim.
